# predicting-optinum-number-of-clusters
I used Machine Learning to study the module to predict the optimum number of clusters. I used elbow method to determine the optimum number of clusters with help of k-mean classification. With help of Data Visualization I plotted the clutters which helps to understand the module and group the module in a very effective way. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
